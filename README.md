### What Will it Do?
This project will examine the deterministic solution to the Lotka-Volterra model, 
a first-order, nonlinear differential equation. In doing so, plots the solution 
over a period of time *t* as a simulation within a GUI built within Rust. 

It will then describe the process of using a probability generating function 
applied to the Lotka-Volterra model in order to obtain a stochastic solution, 
which will then also be simulated.

Side-by-side comparisons will be made after users use the GUI to declare values 
for the initial parameters. 

Lastly, the project aims to implement its own ODE (Runge-Kutta) solver in order 
to solve the Lotka-Volterra model.
